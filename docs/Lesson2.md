# Lesson 2: Integers, Powers and Roots

Integers are formed by the set of natural numbers plus the negative numbers. To understand what are integers, first let's understand why they started to be necessary in our daily life. It was not so long ago that negative numbers were included in arithmetic problems here, in the western world. Until the 19th century the negative numbers where considered as natural numbers which where part of aritmetic operations of subtraction. They where not considered independently as we use them nowadays. Perhaps this is a good thing! You will soon understand why. 

The Chineses, since 200 BCE (Before Common Era) were already using negative numbers to calculate taxes and commercial operations. To identify negative numbers they used colors - red for positive numbers and black for negative numbers. See the image below:

<br />

This symbology for numbers used in China is called "Chinese Rod Numbers". The horizontal and vertical paterns associated with each number is meant for writing them together, laterally, alternating horizontal and vertical patterns. See the example bellow:

<br />   


Observe the last number and how the zeros are represented. If only one zero were inside of the blank space, the number 8 should be represented vertically, not horizontally, so, by deduction you find that there are two zeros at the blank space between 5 and 8. Interesting, right? 

In the daily life, positive and negative numbers were used to represent earnings and debts. For example: let's say that you are selling apples. The apple costs 1 Euro each. John, your neighbor comes and buys 5 apples. You earn 5 Euro and John has less 5 Euro in his pocket. If John cannot pay you at that moment, he will be in debt of 5 Euro and you will take note in your notebook associating John with 5 black rods. Like this:

> <br />   
> My notebook:  <br />   
> neighbor John - IIIII  <br />   
> Mary - <font color="red">IIIII</font>  <br />   
> Peter - <font color="red">III</font>  <br />   
> <br />   
> Total - <font color="red">III</font> <br />   
> <br />   
<br />    

In this day you have a positive balance. You earned three Euro. Nice! So, notice that the red symbols cancel the black ones.

Let's now see graphically how we could represent positive and negative numbers.
