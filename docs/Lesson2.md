# Lesson 2: Integers, Powers and Roots

Integers are formed by the set of natural numbers plus the negative numbers. To understand what are integers first let's understand why they started to be necessary in our daily life. It was not so long ago that negative numbers were included in arithmetic problems here, in the western world. Until the 19th century the negative numbers where considered as natural numbers which where part of aritmetic operations of subtraction. They where not considered independently as we use them nowadays. Perhaps this is a good thing! You will soon understand why. 

The chineses, since 200 BCE (Before Common Era) were already using negative numbers to calculate taxes and commercial operations. To identify negative numbers they used colors - red for positive numbers and black for negative numbers. See the image below:
