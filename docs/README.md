<h1>Studying interactively with Python</h1>

The lessons are based on the Cambridge lower secondary curriculum for teenagers from 11 up to 15 years old. For accessing the content you can click on the left links or download the notebooks. However, It is important to clarify that I am not following linearly the proposed curriculum. My approach is based in meaninful learning, so to say, I try to present the knowledge as long as it is needed to disclose the problem proposed. If you are a teacher, it is important to complement this material with your standard textbook to practice also mechanically some concepts that need to be repeated to be fully understood as, for example, to understand the <b> arithmetic rules </b> or the <b>laws of algebra</b>.

The content exhibited at the website is slightly different from the content available at the notebooks. I am using this feature to make it more interesting for teenagers. But if you want to interact with the codes it is necessary to download the notebooks and follow the instructions.

The first instruction is: download the package Anaconda to be able to interact with the codes. You can use this <a href="https://www.anaconda.com">link</a>. After the installation, you need to launch the module named "Jupyter Notebook". If you only need to see the content inside of the notebooks you just need to click on the files listed at the github or you can open it using an external viewer named "nbviewer". You can find it using this <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org">link</a>. To open the notebook, copy and paste the address of the page.

You can create a new notebook and add only the codes you are interested to test or you can use the notebooks I have created by restarting the  "Kernel" at the upper toolbar. If you don't know how to do it, you can open this <a href="https://github.com/raquelsilva/programming_for_teens/wiki/First-step">wiki link</a> link to see how to do this.
